# Workflow of land cover mapping on the Island of Hispaniola to track the primary forest loss
We use the COLD algorithm ([COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425719301002)) and Landsat time-series to track the primary forest loss on the Island of Hispaniola.
