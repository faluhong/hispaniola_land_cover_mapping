# Workflow of land cover mapping on the Island of Hispaniola to track the primary forest loss
We used the COLD algorithm ([COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425719301002)) 
and Landsat time-series to track the primary forest loss on the Island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic). 

We generated annual 30-meter land cover map in Haiti and the Dominican Republic from 1996 to 2022.  
The land cover types include: 
(1) Developed 
(2) Primary wet forest 
(3) Primary dry forest
(4) Secondary forest
(5) Shrub/Grass
(6) Water
(7) Wetland
(8) Other
